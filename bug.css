The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentage values inside nested elements.  For example:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

.inner {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```

In this case, `100%` inside `.inner` is calculated relative to the parent container, not the viewport. This can lead to unexpected widths, especially when nesting multiple elements.
